- 👋 Hi, I’m Luisa
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end web development
- 🌱 I’m currently practicing what I've learned with JavaScript, Html, CSS and Vue.Js. I'm working on putting together my portfolio to look for my first job in web development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help me grow and learn. I will soon begin a journey into open source
